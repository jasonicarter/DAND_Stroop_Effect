## Projects

### [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_Stroop_Effect)

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect,
a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data
and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

> Well done by showing the key test statistics correctly step by step. Conclusion drawn is well aligned wit the test result.

### [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_Titanic_Data_Analysis)

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas.
Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

> You have postulated several meaningful questions and have provided a thoughtful investigation in turn. Asking the right questions is, arguably, the most important part in data analysis. Well done!
>
> Truly outstanding work on the visualizations. The plots are varied and intuitively make sense with the idea being portrayed.

### [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_OpenStreetMap_Data_MongoDB)

Choose any area of the world in [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and use data munging techniques,
such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity,
to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

> An outstanding work demonstrating a variety of auditing and cleaning procedures.
>
> I must say, terrific work on the formatting and presentation of this project. The information is concisely provided and presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner without overwhelming the reader with large blocks of code and unnecessary detail.

### [Explore and Summarize Data](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_Prosper_Loan_Data_EDA_R)

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables
and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

> Awesome work! There isn't much I can suggest to improve this project further.

### [Identify Fraud from Enron Email](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_Enron_Email_Data_Machine_Learning)

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees
who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### [Make Effective Data Visualization](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_Data_Visualization_D3)

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data.
Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory
and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

> This is a very slick chart design. Nice job finding a way to concentrate a lot of information into a compact, clean and readable space. I really like the introductory information below the chart title as well as how the neighborhoods were sorted by housing population ratio. The neighborhood map also ads a nice exploratory element to the chart.

### [Design an A/B Test](https://github.com/jasonicarter/DAND_AB_Testing)

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run.
Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
